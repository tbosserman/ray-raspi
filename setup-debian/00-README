Release Notes
-------------

2024/08/15
----------
Major update to the automated install process:
1. Uses update-alternatives to make the ITS-logo backgground the default
   background image for all newly created users.
2. Greatly reduced the number of files put into /etc/skel. I figured out how
   to do the "minimum required change" to achieve "maximum desired result".
----------
1. Run "make". This will create:
   - skeleton.tar.gz: This goes into /etc/skel at OS install time.
   - setup.sh: The original one you have to run by hand.
   - setup-auto.sh: The one that gets used by automated install.
2. Put preseed.cfg and setup-auto.sh on your web server where they can be found
   at http://<domain>/d-i/bookworm
3. When installing Debian, choose "Advanced Options" and then
   "Automated Install".
4. After install, reboot, login as root (or admin) and start adding users.
5. Don't forget to configure noip2 (noip2 -c)

NOTES regarding setting default background:

DIR=/usr/share/images/desktop-base
update-alternatives --install $DIR/desktop-background desktop-background \
    $DIR/login-background-2.jpg 50
update-alternatives --set desktop-background $DIR/login-background-2.jpg

Interactive way (will prompt you):
update-alternatives --config desktop-background
