1. make_setup.sh
2. Install the base debian with absolutely NOTHING!
3. Reboot and login as root
4. Somehow get setup.sh onto that debian install. Maybe USB stick?
   I installed openssh-client and krb5-user so I could scp it.
5. Reboot, login as root, and start adding users.
6. Don't forget to configure noip2 (noip2 -c)
